Catalog of Rare Diseases

The goal is to create an online catalog of 230 rare diseases, using the d3 javascript library and the web audio API. Currently it's a fixed-media music composition based on a Max patch (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DtO6oasmE8).
The code here is a simple pie chart made with d3, based on this Observable notebook: [https://observablehq.com/d/406232d3d1d682bb](https://observablehq.com/d/bcb0bc562275156d)

The radius of each arc corresponds to the number of genes associated with each disease ("Ngenes" on the spreadsheet). Other information is displayed on mouseover.

Next I want to add sound to this chart, so if you click on a disease, you can hear its DNA promoter sequence. The background harmony comes from each category of disease; on the chart, these are colors.
